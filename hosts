# This is the default Ansible 'hosts' file.
#
# It should live in /etc/ansible/hosts but in this case I've moved it to
# to the local directory and changed ansible.cfg
#
#   - Comments begin with the '#' character
#   - Blank lines are ignored
#   - Groups of hosts are delimited by [header] elements
#   - You can enter hostnames or ip addresses
#   - A hostname/ip can be a member of multiple groups
